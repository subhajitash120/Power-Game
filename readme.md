Welcome to the Power Game! This is a simple 2D platformer game built using Pygame in Python. The player controls a character that can move left, right, and jump to avoid enemies, collect coins, and gain power-ups. The game features multiple levels, increasing difficulty, and interactive visuals.

4. Power-ups: Collect power-ups to restore 20 health. Health cannot exceed 100.
5. Levels: The game gets harder as you progress. Each level increases the speed of enemies and coins.
